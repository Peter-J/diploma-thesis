# This project hosts:
Code written as part of my diploma thesis.
This code utilizes RoadRunner to simulate Stochastic Reaction Networks, further more R is used to plot empiric densities.

The code in the additional files can be used to keep the simulation running based on a *cronjob* ([cronjob.sh](https://github.com/Peter-J/diploma-thesis/blob/master/cronjob.sh), no not an executable) and [keep-running.sh](https://github.com/Peter-J/diploma-thesis/blob/master/keep-running.sh). You should modify `USER` to be your username and / or path in both files.

There is code to simulate Stochastic Reaction Networks using [MATLAB](https://github.com/Peter-J/diploma-thesis/blob/master/MatlabSimBioSSA.m) and [R](https://github.com/Peter-J/diploma-thesis/blob/master/GillespieSSAusingR.R) aswell, but this was just written for comparison. **Do not expect these two files** ([MatlabSimBioSSA.m](https://github.com/Peter-J/diploma-thesis/blob/master/MatlabSimBioSSA.m) and [GillespieSSAusingR.R](https://github.com/Peter-J/diploma-thesis/blob/master/GillespieSSAusingR.R)) **to be maintained.**

Here a link will be added to the simulation data already created.

#Licence

**This does not have a licence yet.** I would prefere something in the range of:
* You can do pretty much what ever you want, but
* you have to attribute
* you have to use the same licence
* you have to publish source code
* you may not get rich using this code, i.e.
  * getting paid or being funded (e.g. as academic staff, scientist) and using it is __admissible__, even though using something for work is concidered commercial use.
  * win a prize  / file a patent for a drug / scientific discovery / software or whatever you developed, while using this code __without__ giving an adequate share to the guys from https://github.com/sys-bio and me is __not admissible__.
  * selling anything that was developed while using this code or based on this code __without__ giving an adequate share to the guys from https://github.com/sys-bio and me is __not admissible__.

#Attribute:
* The python code is based on the [TelluriumTemplate.py](https://github.com/Peter-J/diploma-thesis/tree/master/Templates) which is automatically generated by the spyder editor in the Tellurium package from the [sys-bio guys.](https://github.com/sys-bio/tellurium/blob/c17337d50911ff9cc9a03885bfb4ecd24500f06f/spyder_mod/spyderlib/plugins/editor.py#L1474-L1497)
  * the traces of this template should be considered marginal
* The MATLAB code is 95% based on https://de.mathworks.com/help/simbio/examples/comparing-ssa-and-explicit-tau-leaping-stochastic-solvers.html
* the GillespieSSAusingR.R code was written using the R integrated help `?ssa`, which is straight forward.
