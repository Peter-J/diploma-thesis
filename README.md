# This project hosts:
Code written as a part of my diploma thesis.
This code utilizes RoadRunner to simulate Stochastic Reaction Networks, further more R is used to plot empiric densities.

The code in the additional files can be used to keep the simulation running based on a *cronjob* ([cronjob.sh](https://github.com/Peter-J/diploma-thesis/blob/master/cronjob.sh), no not an executable) and [keep-running.sh](https://github.com/Peter-J/diploma-thesis/blob/master/keep-running.sh). You should modify `USER` to be your username and / or path in both files.

There is code to simulate Stochastic Reaction Networks using [MATLAB](https://github.com/Peter-J/diploma-thesis/blob/master/MatlabSimBioSSA.m) and [R](https://github.com/Peter-J/diploma-thesis/blob/master/GillespieSSAusingR.R) aswell, but this was just written for comparison. **Do not expect these two files** ([MatlabSimBioSSA.m](https://github.com/Peter-J/diploma-thesis/blob/master/MatlabSimBioSSA.m) and [GillespieSSAusingR.R](https://github.com/Peter-J/diploma-thesis/blob/master/GillespieSSAusingR.R)) **to be maintained.**

###Todo:
- [ ] Add a link to the simulation data already created.
- [ ] Exchange the plot function in the Simulation_linux.py file to work

#Licence goal/idea

**This is not a licence, this is an idea for a licence.** I would prefere something in the range of:
* You can do pretty much what ever you want, but
* you have to attribute
* you have to use the same licence
* you have to publish your source code (e.g. using GitHub), if you publish anything (based on or using this code) and made any non obvious changes to the source code, i.e.:
 * obvious changes: almost anything above line 50 in the python files / changing the anitimony model or any parameter 
 * non obvious changes: adding / changing functionality 
* you may not get rich using this code, i.e.:
  * getting paid or being funded (e.g. as academic staff, scientist) and using it __is admissible__, even though using something for work is concidered commercial use.
  * win a prize  / file a patent for a drug / scientific discovery / software or whatever you developed, while using this code __without__ giving an adequate share to the guys from [sys-bio](https://github.com/sys-bio), any contributor to this project and  me __is not admissible__.
  * selling anything that was developed while using this code or based on this code __without__ giving an adequate share to the guys from [sys-bio](https://github.com/sys-bio), any contributor to this project and  me __is not admissible__.

What *adequate* is, should be negotiated upfront. If no agreement is found the mentioned cases above are __not admissible__. I am not greedy, I just think "If you are good at something, don't do it for free", being a good person does not pay your bills.

* The MATLAB code is 95% based on https://de.mathworks.com/help/simbio/examples/comparing-ssa-and-explicit-tau-leaping-stochastic-solvers.html
* the GillespieSSAusingR.R code was written using the R integrated help `?ssa`, which is straight forward.
