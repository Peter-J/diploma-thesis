There are two folders for simulation-data.

The data in one folder has seperate files for each combination of N and t. The data was generated using my private computer. This can be plotted using PlotDensityOld or you could simply merge it using your console and `cat *.csv >> alldata.csv`.

The other folder contains only two files, one file per reaction-network.
Plotting is slower as the whole file has to be parsed, but the plot-function is the newer one with more features.
This data was generated using the computation-pool from my university.
